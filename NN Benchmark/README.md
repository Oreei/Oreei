# Neural Network Parameter Testing with MATLAB

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a MATLAB project focused on evaluating the performance impact of various neural network parameters. 
Through systematic experimentation and benchmarking, this project investigates how different configurations such as learning rate, solver type, activation functions, or the number of fully connected layers influence neural network behavior. 
Benchmarks include a comprehensive set of metrics such as AUC, ROC curves, true positives, false positives, accuracy, precision, error rates, and specificity.

## Datasets

The project utilizes two well-known datasets:

MNIST: A dataset of handwritten digits that is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

Fashion MNIST: A dataset consisting of Zalando's article images, serving as a more challenging replacement for the original MNIST.
Features

Parameter Variation: Explore how changes in network parameters affect performance.

Benchmark Metrics: Utilize a range of metrics to comprehensively evaluate the models.

Visual Representations: Generate visual outputs to illustrate performance characteristics, such as ROC curves and error analysis.

Interpretation and Analysis: Detailed analysis of the results to understand the implications of different parameter settings.
