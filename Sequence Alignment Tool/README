Sequence Alignment Tool

This project develops a software tool for aligning protein sequences, a task in bioinformatics that helps in understanding structural and functional relationships between proteins. 
Our approach uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, integrated with the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix, to compute optimal sequence alignments that can be useful in evolutionary studies and medical research.

Objectives
To create a user-friendly tool for aligning two protein sequences.
To implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm using a dynamic programming approach.
To integrate the BLOSUM62 matrix for scoring alignments, allowing the identification of biologically significant sequence correspondences.

Methodology
The tool is built with VBA for Excel, leveraging its accessibility and functionality to facilitate the alignment process. Users input two sequences, and the software employs the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to find the optimal global alignment. 
This algorithm uses a scoring matrix to determine the alignment score for each pair of residues, considering both matches and mismatches, as well as introducing gaps.

Execution
The software is designed to run in Microsoft Excel with macros enabled. Users can input sequences directly through dialog boxes that guide through the setup. 
The resulting alignments, along with their scores, are displayed within the Excel interface, making it easy to analyze and visualize the results.

Results and Discussion
Our tests show that the tool effectively aligns sequences and provides intuitive outputs that are easy to interpret. 
The ability to adjust scoring parameters and penalties allows users to customize the alignment process according to specific research needs.
