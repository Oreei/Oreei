# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

## Project Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the classic Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using various methods. 
The goal of the TSP is to find the shortest possible route that allows a salesman to visit each city once and return to the origin city. 
This problem is a well-known computational problem in the fields of computer science and operations research.

## Methods Used

The solutions implemented in this repository explore different algorithms and techniques to solve the TSP, each with its unique approach and efficiency. 
The methods include, bfor examples, heuristic, genetic algorithms, and brute force approaches.

The Jupyter Notebook "TSP.ipynb" contains all the implementations and tests of various TSP solutions. The notebook is well-documented with comments explaining the code and methodologies.

Please note that the contents of the notebook and comments are in French.
